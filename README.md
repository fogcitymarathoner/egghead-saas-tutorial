# NextJS SAAS Subscription
Abandon ***egghead*** tutorial because all advice involving 
full circle nextjs-stripe-nextjs stripe checkout was bad.

## Tech Stack
* NextJS
* Kinde Authentication
* Stripe Payment Processing
* MongoDB
* Netlify
* 
### Ngrok must be configured to forward Non-SSL requests
SSL requests stall the create-stripe-customer callback
```aiignore
ngrok http 3000 --schema http,https
```
### NOTE: RLS has to be handled in-code because static code is retrieved as superuser
Test RLS exercises in /api/protected

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
